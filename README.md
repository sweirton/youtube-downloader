Welcome to the YouTube Downloader!

This is a lightweight application that simply takes a URL as an input and produces an MP4 file
with the title as a label.

Key features:
- Graphical user interface
- User feedback via a progress bar and message boxes
- threading for responsiveness
- autopopulating label
- downloads at 720p

Version notes:
This program was run through Cython to test optimization. It was then pushed through the pyinstaller
to create a final product that could be installed to the desktop. It should be able to be run from
the .exe file. This is my first attempt at packaging together a final product.
